# CC:Tweaked Projects
This repo is a list of projects i've worked on for the minecraft CC:Tweaked mod.

Do not expect these to be updated. as i'll probably only update them if i need to use them (which is rare)

## AmethystFarm
A mini project to automatically farm amethyst. Simple to setup.
Download via the following command:
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragmine149/ComputerTweakedProjects/refs/heads/main/AmethystFarm/amethyst.lua
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dragmine149/ComputerTweakedProjects/refs/heads/main/AmethystFarm/startup.lua
```
One turtle can deal with up to 5 buddings at once as one side has to be for some storage.

## Create:Astral -> Farming
This is a canceled project for the create astral modpack. Meant to be a series of robots just farming away.

## Boombox
A music player with a whole ui powered by Basalt.
Still a work in progress, almost done.

## quarry
A modified version of an old program to change it into a chunk based system with using create to travel items instead of normal data.
Cancelled as it's not needed for what it was intended for. Might finish it oneday.
